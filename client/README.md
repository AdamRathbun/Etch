# Etch
Etch is a creative collaboration tool that helps people who are working remotely get their design projects where they need to be. Users can make an account, log in, and mark up and comment on each other's designs for creative editing. 

<!-- **Link to project:**  -->

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, Express, Redux, HTML, CSS, and Canvas

After making an account and logging in, users can create projects (with key project details like image, title, description, etc.). Users can then click on a project to open it up, where they can mark up the design image with various drawing tools and write comments for creative changes. Additional features include approvals, project deletion, sharing, and authentication.

## Optimizations

Given more time, I would've liked to include an additional "sticky comment" feature that allows the user to attach a comment to a sticky on the image that highlights the connected comment when clicked on. This may be in the form nested objects that share an id.

<!-- ## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
